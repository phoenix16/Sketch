# Sketch
Sketch with the largest canvas your phone can offer!
Free up screen real estate by getting rid of menus!

Sketch is an Android drawing app that lets a user associate a drawing menu button with a particular enrolled fingerprint.
This creates menu shortcuts that can be accessed with one's fingerprints.

Sample usage: Touch the fingerprint sensor with
finger 1 to start over with an empty canvas
finger 2 to undo last gesture
finger 3 to switch to an eraser
This app has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy S5, which permits a user register up to 3 fingerprints.
